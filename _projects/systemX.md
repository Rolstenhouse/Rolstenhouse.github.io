# Summary

This project was the final assessment to the [FAU Engineering Scholars Program](http://www.dessa.fau.edu/esp.php), targeted towards individuals with a proclivity to STEM.

During the three-week course we had three 8-hour days of the week where we learned about basics to HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL so basically a crash course in web development. I worked with three other individuals for the final project, Peter Lin, William Garner, and Tiago Baptista. 

We had tried to build a forum that was based around all things old-school computer related and went for a terminal styled theme (build off of `Bootstrap`)

### Status

This project continues to live on at [SystemXComputing](http://lamp.cse.fau.edu/~wgardner2013/SystemXComputing/)
