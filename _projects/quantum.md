Done at hackstart, this hackathon consisted of seeral main points

* Awarded prize for the most unique and problem-solving idea
* Based on open source github project, https://github.com/SheldonNeilson/Android-Alarm-Clock
* Android application developed with android studio, using the Venmo API

Actual implementation behind the idea lacked the availability to donate to other charities, however this is a feature which was planned on being added later on into the project.
