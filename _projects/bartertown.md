# Summary
Over the summer after freshman year, I took place in the <a href="http://hackerhouse.info/">HackerHouse</a> startup accelerator/incubator. This four-month long program (and potentially longer) began with an ideation process, validation, a prototype, more validation, pitching, incorporating and ultimately halting progress on our project, BarterTown.
