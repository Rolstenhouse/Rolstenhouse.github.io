<p>As I was growing up, it was made clear to me that my allowance for spending money would dry up as soon as I was able to earn money independently. Conveniently, Publix had the lowest age to hire, at a paltry 14, and while I had been making some side money at that point selling honey buns and teaching piano, I was eager to earn some “real” money by working for a set number of hours</p>

<h3 id="job-roles">Job Roles</h3>

<p>As a front service clerk, (bag boy), I was the last stop in an experience designed to deliver customer service from the start. Anything we bagged or talked about was done with pleasure, a smiling face, and a positive attitude. Customer satisfaction was of utmost importance, and so small talk and exchanging pleasantries was a mandatory responsibility as the customer walked through the line, or as we took the shopping cart out to their car in order to unload the groceries.</p>

<p>The roles of our job were as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximize amount of groceries in the bag</li>
  <li>Place similar items in the bags (No mixing raw meat with anything else)</li>
  <li>Engage the customer with “How’s your day?” or “The weather is awful today isn’t it?”</li>
  <li>Walk the customer to their car and unload groceries</li>
  <li>Collect up to 5 carts maximum and push back into store</li>
  <li>Clean the bathroom at assigned times</li>
</ul>

<p>These roles were thrilling at first, but became somewhat repetitive down the line.</p>

<p>I credit Publix with giving me a greater sense of discipline and responsibility than I had been used to during school; however, my time there went quickly from constantly engaged, to somewhat mindless. I found myself zoning out during work hours and not truly engaging with the customers.</p>

<p>All in all, it was an experience which I’m glad I had which gave me structure during a time of instability. Publix will forever be my favorite grocery store as I relish in the nostalgia.</p>
