<p><strong><em>Awarded most creative use of BlackRock API</em></strong></p>

<p>Razzle is a personal financial assistant. Running on Amazonâ€™s Echo product, Razzle could be asked to provide insights into whether or not certain stocks were a good buy, what your current investing portfolio will look like in the next year, and the ability to execute trades on behalf of your Robinhood account.</p>

<p>How it broke down:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I used the BlackRock API to get past stock performance and drew a trend line to indicate whether or not a given purchase was a good idea.</li>
  <li>Given the asked for Stock and quantity of shares, Razzle would use Robinhood to execute a market order of the said quantity of shares.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="during-this-project-i-used">During this project I used</h2>

<p><strong>Amazon Alexa</strong>. I wrote an Alexa skill to take various commands (known as intents) from the end user and interface with the AWS Lambda function that was running.</p>

<p>The <strong>BlackRock portfolio analysis API</strong> located at 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.blackrock.com/tools/api-tester/hackathon/portfolio-analysis</code>. 
This API endpoint provides all valuable historical data. For this project, I made use of the trend over the past year and past threeMonths in order to predict growth of the stock.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alexa ask Razzle should I buy Snapchat?</code> 
led to a recommendation not to buy (as of October 2017).</p>

<p>The <strong>Robinhood private API</strong>. Robinhood currently has no public facing API and so all calls must be made through an undocumented API; luckily, there was an existing npm module at
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/aurbano/robinhood-node</code>. 
This API allowed buy orders to be executed on Robinhood from the AWS Lambda client.

<p>All together, this functionality created Razzle, your personal financial assistant.</p>
