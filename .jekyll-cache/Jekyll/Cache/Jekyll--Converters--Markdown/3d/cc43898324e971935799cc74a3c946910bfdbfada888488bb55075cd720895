<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>

<p>At 2AM one night, I had a craving for Krispy Kreme, and in order to find out if the donuts were hot, I had to download an app from the app store. I certainly didn’t need an app for this one time desire, so I accessed the website and spent considerably more time clicking around than I’d like to admit, before giving up.</p>

<p>Rather than go get donuts, I did a quick search on Namecheap and bought the domain name, isthekrispykremehotlighton.com for $10. I assumed and mentally readied myself to plant a camera on top of a friends apartment complex and wait for the hot light to turn onn or off and update the website based on that.</p>

<h2 id="what-ended-up-happening">What ended up happening</h2>

<p>I woke up in the morning with a slight amount of buyer’s remorse and did a little more research, only to discover that the official Krispy Kreme website did in fact update the hot light status on their website, with an API endpoint.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Namecheap doesn’t allow returns on domain names, so rather than have spent $10 in vain, I decided to build out the basic UI and stick with it.</p>

<p>This project was a little trickier than expected because I was determined not to pay anything more for it. In order to do this I took a couple steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signed up for Heroku’s free tier and input my credit card, so I could get access to 1000 free single process hours per month. (A downfall of the free tier is that it times out)</li>
  <li>Set up new-relic to ping the site and report when it’s down (a free plugin from heroku)</li>
  <li>Used flask as my backend server to store the hot light status in order to set notifications</li>
  <li>Stored phone numbers and hot light status in Mlab’s free 500MB mongo DB store</li>
  <li>Ran a looped thread to check the API endpoint every five minutes to make sure my website’s status was still correct</li>
  <li>Had a separate thread run if the hot light was on to email all the phone numbers, a hack I found out about 3 years ago on the useless facts project.</li>
  <li>Added Google Analytics to track how many users visited my site when I launched</li>
</ul>

<p>I used this project as an opportunity to build something for fun, and I really enjoyed working on it. Unfortunately, the codebase is pretty gross, but I intended to use this project to learn and to never update again. It won’t scale and I think that’s cool.</p>
