<p>Only a couple days, after the Spring career showcase, which is the University of Florida’s career day fair, I received a phone call.</p>

<p><em>“Hey is this Robert Olsthoorn?”</em> Yes. <em>We’re calling to see if you would be interested in interviewing for us at Infinite Energy.</em> Absolutely!</p>

<p>And what followed was my first technical interview where I was asked basic web development questions and string manipulation. I was beyond ecstatic at the time that I was given a proper interview and eventual internship with Infinite Energy.</p>

<p>I remember vividly coming into the office the first day of work and receiving a badge with the winding string that attaches to the spool that sits on your belt and thinking <em>“Wow! I remember playing with my mom’s card as a kid.”</em> I was introduced to my team and given a ramp-up project so that I could begin to learn how Java EE would function so that I could contribute to the team’s efforts. After several weeks of the part-time work, I moved on to fixing bugs and getting experience in an Agile development workplace.</p>

<p>About halfway through the internship, there was an organizational restructure of the 30 or so current developers at the company, and I found myself moving away from the web development team onto the billing team, which dealt predominantly with writing SQL queries to issue billing reports to all of our consumers across state lines, and managing the customer service bill information window pane, so that all of the in-house customer service representatives could speak on the phone about relevant data.</p>

<p>At this point, there was an initiative across the company to migrate away from ASP.NET and move towards using AngularJS. I ended up writing AngularJS into the front end of the customer service representative facing side as a module which plugged into the existing architecture. This ended up being my final project.</p>

<p>Infinite Energy provided a great foundation that allowed me to get experience programming in an environment outside of the classroom, with dedicated agile methodology and git branching strategies well implemented. I was able to get a taste of the nuanced flavors of programming specifically by working on the following throughout the summer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrote internal API using C#’s PageMethods to create a deferred UI widget load time with AngularJS injected into ASP.NET</li>
  <li>Built customer page with AngularJS which allowed logged-in users to access their individual messages and documents</li>
  <li>Reduced the inefficiency of logging-in to an aspect by removing a parameter that needed to be entered</li>
  <li>Assisted in development of a WordPress plugin for our marketing team for the release of a new landing page</li>
</ul>
